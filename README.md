Datatypes
JanabScript supports several core datatypes:
•	Integer 
Used for whole numbers.
Example:
•	adad a = 21;
•	Decimal 
Represents numbers with fractional parts. JanabScript allows decimals with precision up to five digits after the decimal point.
Example:
•	nukta pi = 3.14159;
•	Boolean
Used for true/false values. The language uses specific keywords for boolean values: sahi for true and galat for false.
Example:
•	sach flag = sahi;
•	Character 
Holds a single lowercase alphabet character.
Example:
•	harf ch = 'a';
Input/Output
JanabScript provides simple keywords for interacting with the user:
•	Print Output (``)
Outputs text or variable values to the user.
Example:
•	farmai "Hello Janab";
•	Input (``)
Captures input from the user and assigns it to a variable.
Example:
•	sun name;
Control Flow
To direct program execution, JanabScript offers control flow statements:
•	If Statement 
Begins with agar followed by a condition in parentheses.
Example:
•	agar (x > 0) {
•	    // statements to execute if the condition is true
•	}
•	Else Statement 
Provides an alternate block of code if the if condition fails.
Example:
•	warna {
•	    // statements to execute if the condition is false
•	}
Strings
String literals in JanabScript are enclosed in double quotes. They are used to represent text in the code.
Example:
"Janabscript zindabad!";
Comments
Comments allow you to add explanations or disable code without affecting execution:
•	Single Line Comments
Begin with // and continue to the end of the line.
Example:
•	// This is a single-line comment.
•	Multiline Comments
Enclosed between /* and */, spanning multiple lines if needed.
Example:
•	/*
•	   This is a multiline comment.
•	   It can span multiple lines.
•	*/
Arithmetic Operations
JanabScript includes the following arithmetic operators for mathematical expressions:
•	Addition: +
•	Subtraction: -
•	Multiplication: *
•	Division: /
•	Modulus: %
•	Exponentiation: ^
These operators can be used to build and evaluate expressions as part of your programs.
Identifiers
Identifiers are names given to variables. In JanabScript, they must begin with a lowercase letter and may contain lowercase letters, digits, and underscores.
Example:
score_1 = 100;
Examples
Basic Variable Declaration
adad count = 10;
nukta fraction = 0.12345;
sach isActive = sahi;
harf letter = 'a';
Input and Output
farmai "Enter your name:";
sun userName;
farmai "Welcome, " + userName;
Conditional Statements
adad number = 5;
agar (number > 0) {
    farmai "Positive number";
} warna {
    farmai "Non-positive number";
}
Conclusion
JanabScript offers an easy-to-read syntax that covers essential programming features including datatype declarations, input/output operations, control flow, arithmetic expressions, and commenting. This simplicity makes it a great starting point for learning the basics of programming.
Happy coding with JanabScript!
